- ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @JohnWickwastaken
- ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in Face Recognition, OpenCV, or any other python programs. 
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Machine Learning, Data Mining and Business Intelligence.

I am currently looking into a field where my passion lies which is to analyze data and to predict the outcome of the data. I have completed my MCA  few months back where my interests were on machine learning and statistical mathematical analysis using Python and R programming with matplot, seaborn, and many other libraries to plot the analysis which were made. I have huge interest in OpenCV and image recognition using Python.
